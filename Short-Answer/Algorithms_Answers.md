#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)Since there is no depending input data and a is set to 0 this would be considered 0(1). Regardless of the input size the possible out comes will be the same. The comparisons will happen automatically and the function will run as long as a falls into place. Seems like there is a possibility of an infinite loop though...


b)Since there is a while loop imbedded in the for loop and since there will be a dependency on the input data the runtime is O(n*n) or Quadratic time. 



c)Since the Algorithm must analyze all of the input data given and decide whether it will return 0 or run the final return statement. This is O(n)

## Exercise II

This is in a 10 story theoretical building. 

def dropEgg(10): 
safeEgg = false 
safeFloor = 0
starting floor = n
while safeEgg = false
  if eggStatus == notCracked: 
    return safeFloor = n 
    safeEgg = true
  else: 
    return dropEgg(n - 1)

Since this algorithm is solely based off of what n is equal to I would say that this is an O(n) 
runtime.
