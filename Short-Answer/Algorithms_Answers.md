#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)This is O(n) since it is looping through the data based off of the input size. 


b)O(log n) as the function reaches the while loop it begins the runtime will only grow as n increases. 



c)Since the Algorithm must analyze all of the input data given and decide whether it will return 0 or run the recursive statement. This is O(n)

## Exercise II

since a buidling is technically a presorted list of numbers youd be able to start in the middle and work your way up or down depending on the out come of the initial egg drop. If it were a 10 story building you could start at 5, drop the egg if it were to crack then proceed downward by cutting the floors in half and repeating the process on the second or third floor depending on if youre rounding up or down.This is similar to binary search trees.
